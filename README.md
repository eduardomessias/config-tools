# Useful tools
A repository to keep all useful configuration script and documents, and tools that I used at least once.

## Tools list
- **GIT-TF**
This is an old tool from Microsoft that helps you migrate TFS repo to a GIT repo, and vice-versa. It's also possible to migrate from on-premise TFS to a cloud TFS preserving the changeset history without using the SQL Server, which was the scenario I was when I found this tool.
